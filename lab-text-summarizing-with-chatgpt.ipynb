    "\n",
    "## ✅ Overview\n",
    "In this exercise, I worked with three different prompts, each representing a different use case. I rewrote each prompt in multiple creative ways and analyzed how the AI responded.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 Prompt 1 – Personal Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Description:**  \n",
    "A short introduction about myself including education and bootcamps.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Observations:**\n",
    "- Correct grammar improved AI understanding (e.g., \"I graduated\" is better than \"I'm graduated\").\n",
    "- Rewriting it in bullet-point format helped the model structure the answer better.\n",
    "- Adding clarity and separating ideas improved accuracy and readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 Prompt 2 – BMW Company Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "**Description:**  \n",
    "Informative text about BMW’s history, brands, production, and global presence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Observations:**\n",
    "- Accurate outputs when the input remained factual and structured.\n",
    "- Simplified or vague rewrites sometimes led to hallucinated facts.\n",
    "- Keeping a professional tone and chronological flow worked best.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 Prompt 3 – What is a Prompt?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Description:**  \n",
    "Explains what a prompt is and how it works for text-to-text and text-to-image models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Observations:**\n",
    "- Examples (like “astronaut riding a horse”) helped the model stay focused.\n",
    "- Rephrasing in simple language made the explanation easier to understand.\n",
    "- Well-organized prompts produced structured and detailed outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚠️ Issues & Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "- Vague prompts led to hallucinations or incorrect facts.\n",
    "- Poor grammar reduced clarity and impacted model performance.\n",
    "- Overly long sentences confused the model and reduced output quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📘 Lessons Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Clarity = Better Output**: Clean grammar and structure lead to more accurate results.\n",
    "- **Context Helps**: Adding purpose or instruction improves alignment.\n",
    "- **Style Can Be Controlled**: Tone and detail can be guided through word choice.\n",
    "- **Rewriting Matters**: Tiny changes in phrasing significantly affect responses.\n",
